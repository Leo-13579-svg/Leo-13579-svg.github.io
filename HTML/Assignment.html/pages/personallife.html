        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>In 1949, Buffett developed a crush on a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele. In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt to capture her attention was unsuccessful, his music interest became a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life, and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity.[101]
            In 1952,[102] Buffett married Susan at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The following year, they had their first child, Susan Alice. She was followed by Howard (b. 1954) and Peter (b. 1958). The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan's death in July 2004. Their only daughter Susan lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc., and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation.[103]           
            In 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old—she had lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in 1977.[104][105] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and Christmas cards to friends were signed "Warren, Susie and Astrid".[106] Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an interview on the Charlie Rose Show shortly before her death, in a rare glimpse into Buffett's personal life.[107]           
            Buffett disowned his son Peter's adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated in the Jamie Johnson documentary The One Percent about the growing economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one of her "adored grandchildren",[108] Buffett wrote Nicole a letter stating, "I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or a cousin".[109][110][111] By 2022, Buffett and she had reconciled.[112][113]

            His 2006 annual salary was about $100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies.[114] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000.[115] In 1958, Buffett purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for US$31,500 (equivalent to $341,723 in 2023).[116][117] He also owned a vacation home in Laguna Beach, California,[118] which he purchased for $150,000 in 1971. He sold it for $7.5 million in 2018.[119] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7 million of Berkshire's funds on a private jet, Buffett named it "The Indefensible", later renamed "The Indispensable".[120] This act was at odds with his past condemnation of extravagant spending by other CEOs.[121] Buffett sold the jet prior to mid-1999, and has since usually flown with Berkshire's flight services businesses.[122]  
             Bridge is such a sensational game that I wouldn't mind being in jail if I had three cellmates who were decent players and who were willing to keep the game going twenty-four hours a day.

             Buffett is an avid bridge player, which he plays with Gates[124] and champion player Sharon Osberg; he is said to spend 12 hours a week playing the game.[125][126] In 2006, he sponsored a bridge match for the Buffett Cup. Modeled on the Ryder Cup in golf—held immediately before it in the same city—the teams are chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams provided by each country.[127]   
            He is a dedicated, lifelong follower of Nebraska football, and attends as many games as his schedule permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini, following the 2007 season, stating, "It was getting kind of desperate around here".[128] He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant coach.[129] Buffett was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2009.[130] Buffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated series called "Secret Millionaires Club" with chief Andy Heyward of DiC Entertainment. The series features Buffett and Munger and teaches children healthy financial habits.[131][132]            
             Buffett was raised as a Presbyterian, but has since described himself as agnostic.[133] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and drove his own automobile,[134] a Cadillac DTS.[135] In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine.[136] In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life.[137] In February 2020, Buffett revealed in a CNBC interview that he had traded in his flip phone for an iPhone 11.[138] Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the Omaha World Herald, which his company acquired in 2011.
            Buffett's speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska, an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both the United States and abroad, giving it the nickname "Woodstock of Capitalism". Berkshire's annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett's writings are known for containing quotations from sources as varied as the Bible and Mae West,[139] as well as advice in a folksy, Midwestern style and numerous jokes.
             In April 2017, Buffett (an avid Coca-Cola drinker and shareholder in the company) agreed to have his likeness placed on Cherry Coke products in China. Buffett was not compensated for this advertisement.[140][141] Buffett is very distantly related to the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama.[142] Buffett was a longtime friend of singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett until Jimmy's death in September 2023, and they would often refer to one another as "Uncle Warren" and "Cousin Jimmy". The two took a DNA test which revealed no relation.[143]</p>
